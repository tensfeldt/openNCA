\title{The volume of distribution normalized by weight}
\usage{
vssw(vss = NULL, normbs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{vss}{The volume of distribution at steady-state (given in a vector form)}

\item{normbs}{The body weight of the subject/experimental unit (given in a vector form)}
}
\description{
The volume of distribution at steady state based on the observed or predicted last measurable plasma
concentration for a substance administered by intravascular dosing normalized by the body weight of the subject.
