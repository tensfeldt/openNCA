\title{Linear Up-Log Down Trapezoidal Area Under the First Moment Curve (AUMC) Calculation Method}
\usage{
aumc_lin_up_log_down(conc = NULL, time = NULL, exflag = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{conc}{The concentration data (given in a vector form)}

\item{time}{The time data (given in a vector form)}

\item{exflag}{The exclude flag data (given in a numeric vector)}
}
\description{
Linear trapezoidal while concentrations are increasing, and log trapezoidal while
concentrations are decreasing; the assessment is made on a step by step basis for
each portion of the profile i.e. t1 to t2. If Ci or Ci+1 is 0 then the linear trapezoidal
rule is used.
