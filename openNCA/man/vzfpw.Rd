vzfpw(vzfp = NULL, normbs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{vzfp}{The volume of distribution data (numeric value)}

\item{normbs}{The dose data (numeric value)}

\description{
The volume of distribution associated with the terminal slope following extravascular administration
divided by the fraction of dose absorbed, calculated using the predicted value of the last non-zero
concentration, divided by the body weight of the subject  \cr
