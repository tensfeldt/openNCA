\title{Volume of distribution (observed) based on the terminal phase.}
\usage{
vzo(kel = NULL, aucinfo = NULL, dose = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{kel}{The terminal phase rate constant for the concentration-time profile of interest (numeric value)}

\item{aucinfo}{The area under the concentration versus time curve from time 0 to infinity (Observed) (numeric value)}

\item{dose}{The dose data (numeric value)}
}
\description{
Volume of distribution (observed) based on the terminal phase.
}
\details{
\strong{Model M2 and M3}
Single Dose Equation only not calculated at steady-state (only VZ/P is calculated using AUCTAU as the correct PK variable)
