\usage{
run_M1_SD_computation(data = NULL, map = NULL, method = 1,
  model_regex = "^M1(SD)*?$", parameter_list = list(),
  return_list = list(), optimize_kel_debug = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The dataframe that contains the raw data}

\item{map}{The dataframe that contains the map data}

\item{method}{The methos of calculation for Area Under the Curve (see Details below)}

\item{parameter_list}{The list of parameters to calculate (empty by default)}

}
\description{
This function will compute all the relevant parameters for a M1 model Single Dose (SD).\cr
}
\details{
\strong{Methods:} You can use the following methods to calculate AUC: \cr
\enumerate{
 \item \strong{1: Linear-Log Trapazoidal Rule}(default method): The linear method is used up to Tmax (the
 first occurance of Cmax) and the log trapezoidal method is used for the remainder of the profile. If
 Ci or Ci+1 is 0 then the linear trapezoidal rule is used.
 \item \strong{2: Linear Trapazoidal Rule}: The linear method is used for the entire profile.
 \item \strong{3: Log Trapazoidal Rule}: The log trapezoidal method is used for the entire profile. If
 Ci or Ci+1 is 0 then the linear trapezoidal rule is used.
 \item \strong{4: Linear Up - Log Down Trapazoidal Rule}: Linear trapezoidal while the concentrations
 are increasing and log trapezoidal while the concentration are decreasing, the assessment is made on
 a step basis for each portion of the profile i.e. t1 to t2. If Ci or Ci+1 is 0 then the linear
 trapezoidal rule is used.

\section{Note}{

By default all the return list options are selected and calculated if 'parameter_list' is not specified. Please refer to \code{\link{mct_template}}
to get more calrification on how to specify which parameters to calculate to this function if you wish to subset the default caculated parameters. \cr
By default 'display_list' argument is empty, which means that this function will return all caculated parameters specifed by the 'parameter_list' argument.
Only specfiy a list of parameters to the 'display_list' if you want to subset the calculated parameters returned as a result of this function. \cr
By default 'return_list' argument is empty, which means that this function will not append parameters passed from 'data' argument.
Only specfiy a list of parameters to the 'return_list' if you want to return them as a result of this function. \cr
If 'optimize_kel' is FALSE AND KEL is not one of the parameters (default or specified by 'parameter_list' argument) then
this functions will return a datafram. If 'optimize_kel' is FALSE AND KEL is one of the parameters (default or specified by 'parameter_list' argument) then
this functions will return a list with 'data_out' and 'est_data'. If 'optimize_kel' is TRUE AND KEL is one of the parameters (default or specified
by 'parameter_list' argument) then this functions will return a list with 'data_out', 'optimized_kel_flag' and 'est_data'.
If 'optimize_kel' is TRUE AND KEL is not one of the parameters (default or specified by 'parameter_list' argument) then
this functions will return a list with 'data_out' and 'optimized_kel_flag'. \cr
Please note that this function does not contain all the features of a M1 SD computation, so it is recommended that you
use the parent function \code{\link{run_computation}}
}
