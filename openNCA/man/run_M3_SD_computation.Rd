\strong{Methods:} You can use the following methods to calculate AUC: \cr
\enumerate{
 \item \strong{Linear-Log Trapazoidal Rule}(default method): The linear method is used up to Tmax (the
 first occurrence of Cmax) and the log trapezoidal method is used for the remainder of the profile. If
 Ci or Ci+1 is 0 then the linear trapezoidal rule is used.
 \item \strong{Linear Trapazoidal Rule}: The linear method is used for the entire profile.
 \item \strong{Log Trapazoidal Rule}: The log trapezoidal method is used for the entire profile. If
 Ci or Ci+1 is 0 then the linear trapezoidal rule is used.
 \item \strong{Linear Up - Log Down Trapazoidal Rule}: Linear trapezoidal while the concentrations
 are increasing and log trapezoidal while the concentration are decreasing, the assessment is made on
 a step basis for each portion of the profile i.e. t1 to t2. If Ci or Ci+1 is 0 then the linear
 trapezoidal rule is used.

\section{Note}{

By default all the return list options are selected and calculated if 'parameter_list' is not specified. Please refer to MCT
to get more calcification on how to specify which parameters to calculate to this function if you wish to subset the default calculated parameters. \cr
By default 'display_list' argument is empty, which means that this function will return all calculated parameters specified by the 'parameter_list' argument.
Only specify a list of parameters to the 'display_list' if you want to subset the calculated parameters returned as a result of this function. \cr
By default 'return_list' argument is empty, which means that this function will not append parameters passed from 'data' argument.
Only specify a list of parameters to the 'return_list' if you want to return them as a result of this function. \cr
If 'optimize_kel' is FALSE AND KEL is not one of the parameters (default or specified by 'parameter_list' argument) then
this functions will return a dataframe. If 'optimize_kel' is FALSE AND KEL is one of the parameters (default or specified by 'parameter_list' argument) then
this functions will return a list with 'data_out' and 'est_data'. If 'optimize_kel' is TRUE AND KEL is one of the parameters (default or specified
by 'parameter_list' argument) then this functions will return a list with 'data_out', 'optimized_kel_flag' and 'est_data'.
If 'optimize_kel' is TRUE AND KEL is not one of the parameters (default or specified by 'parameter_list' argument) then
this functions will return a list with 'data_out' and 'optimized_kel_flag'. \cr
Please note that this function does not contain all the features of a M3 SD computation, so it is recommended that you
use the parent function \code{\link{run_computation}}
}
